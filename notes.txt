Current Problems:

missing comments on code / utils - add in
utils.php is extremlly messy - clean up functions
Open to SQLInjection currently
Missing alot of security checks
Naming convention is horrible (fetch or get)..?! messy + hard to read

Basic problems with php to be checked
$_GET['value'] could be defined but be null : ballot_id=
    - results in sql error (check for this)

Staff:
Create Ballot
- Check if amount of candidates to vote for > candidates
- Fix apostrophes
- multiple house selection - dropdown checkboxes

Manage Ballot
- check if user sending update request is actually owner / or is an admin

View 
- doing all the processing everytime might hurt? (worried about how we request all the users everytime (could we store on database somewhere..?))
    - adding up all the results every time is not efficent - store + cache on database results (and have user send update request)
Thoughts:
Admin realistically wouldn't check a users vote individually - no point showing (export to excel)

Student:
Student can vote twice
Have to check result during insertion into database and not during <form>
- danger of student editing php raw since we don't use POST 

Notes:
dynamic pages are php, static html
add collapsable on admin view for ease of use
